The Two-Page Plan That Transforms Account-Based Marketing

Is your enterprise still operating without a shared plan - an easy-to-follow ABM Go-To-Market framework and playbook?

This is like asking your sales and marketing team to reach the same destination using different maps, or no map at all. That’s when conversion rates suffer and high-value accounts seem unattainable.

After training 300+ B2B organisations, I've seen how a summary, structured two-page GTM plan transforms performance. These are the key elements that underpin it:

# Market Planning: When you clearly define the specific problems you solve and your ideal customer profile, both teams focus only on best-fit opportunities—dramatically improving conversion rates and shortening sales cycles.

# Account Planning: By mapping decision-making units and buying committees, your marketing reaches the right stakeholders while sales navigates the complete landscape of influencers—not just the most visible contacts.

# Sales & Marketing Process Alignment: Understanding the buyer's journey from problem recognition to tipping point ensures your teams engage at exactly the right moments with exactly the right messages.

# Campaign Playbooks: Defined multi-touch strategies ensure every customer interaction builds upon the last—creating a consistent experience whether they're engaging with marketing content or speaking to sales.

# Measurement Frameworks: Clear KPIs for each funnel stage show exactly what's working and what needs improvement, eliminating guesswork and finger-pointing when targets aren't met.

# Cross-Functional Organisation: Teams working from the same plan operate as a unified revenue engine rather than separate departments occasionally forced to collaborate.

# Velocity Metrics: When everyone understands the pipeline conversion benchmarks needed to hit targets, your forecast becomes reliable and resource allocation becomes confident.

A two-page, highly visual plan like myGTMplan ensures everyone agrees and can see exactly how target accounts are identified, nurtured, converted, and expanded. This clarity is the foundation of predictable revenue growth.
