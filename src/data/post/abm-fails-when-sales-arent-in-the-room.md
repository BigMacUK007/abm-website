ABM fails when sales aren't in the room

That's why we coach both teams together

The latest research confirms what we have seen many times: Account-Based Marketing campaigns that don't involve sales from day one are doomed to fail.

LinkedIn's research shows 84% of marketers say ABM significantly helps retain and expand existing relationships – but only when there's genuine sales and marketing collaboration.

The good news is that CIM ABM training shows you exactly how to achieve that alignment.

Start Your ABM Journey the Right Way

Option 1: CIM One-Day ABM Virtual Workshop (Open Course)
Our interactive online workshop is ideal for the designated 'ABM lead' in your organisation, and other team members, looking to explore this approach effectively.

You'll leave with:
- A framework to align sales and marketing with the buyer's journey
- Practical tactics to generate awareness and leads in target markets
- Qualification and nurturing strategies that close more deals
- KPIs to measure ABM-based sales and marketing performance

This workshop provides the perfect foundation for anyone tasked with implementing ABM in their organisation.

Next dates: May 21, June 2025. Delivered via: Interactive online sessions

Option 2: Progress to Tailored In-house ABM Training

After establishing your ABM foundations through the open course, the natural next step is bringing your entire team together.

Our bespoke online workshops bring your sales and marketing teams together to build on your new knowledge and develop:

- A customised ABM strategy for your specific target accounts
- Team-specific playbooks that ensure seamless handoffs
- A shared measurement framework that rewards collaboration
- Tailored content strategies for your unique industry challenges
- These follow-on workshops ensure the entire team speaks the same ABM language and works towards shared goals.

Having helped over 300 sales and marketing managers and directors across the UK and EMEA maximise their ABM ROI, we focus on practical implementation rather than just theory.
