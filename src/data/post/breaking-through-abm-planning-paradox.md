Breaking Through ABM’s Planning Paradox

Ever noticed how we can spot opportunities in other companies’ marketing strategies, yet sometimes struggle to perfect our own? There’s psychology behind this phenomenon - it’s called Solomon’s Paradox, named after the ancient king renowned for solving everyone’s problems except his own.

The ABM Challenge

This insight is relevant in Account-Based Marketing, where objectivity and fresh perspectives are crucial for success. When reviewing peer ABM programmes, we can identify opportunities for:

- More strategic account selection
- Deeper personalisation opportunities
- Stronger sales and marketing alignment
- More effective content strategies

Yet when planning our own ABM programmes, we can get caught in analysis paralysis or stick too closely to familiar approaches.

The Power of Collaborative Learning

ABM-ers are turning this into a competitive advantage. The most successful programmes are seeing good to great results through collaborative approaches:

- 40% higher account engagement rates
- 50% reduction in strategic decision-making time
- Significantly improved sales-marketing alignment
- More innovative approach to account targeting

How Are They Achieving This?

The key lies in structured collaboration. Through CIM-accredited ABM workshops, marketing leaders are:

- Gaining fresh perspectives on their ABM strategies
- Learning from cross-industry success stories
- Building valuable peer networks
- Developing practical, actionable frameworks
