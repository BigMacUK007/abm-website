Are you appearing in AI searches by your target prospects?

Try this test: Open ChatGPT and ask: "Which [your category] providers should a [your ICP] company evaluate?"

Are you mentioned?

We ran this test for a working capital solutions client last month. ChatGPT mentioned three competitors. Our client? Not once.

Here's what's changed: Your target CFO isn't starting at your website anymore. They're asking AI for recommendations.

If you're not in that response, you've lost the deal before you knew it existed.

No website visit. No intent signal. No chance to compete.

The new ABM buyer journey:
- AI conversation (invisible)
- Shortlist formation (invisible)
- Intent signal appears (finally visible)
- Website visit (you start tracking)

We're all optimising steps 3-4. The winners are dominating steps 1-2.

What's working:

→ Case studies in trade publications (not your blog)
→ Comparison content that AI can cite
→ Technical fundamentals (schema, NAP consistency)

Recent research: 61% of AI responses cite editorial media sources - jumping to 72% for value-focused queries. Separately, Muck Rack found 95% of AI citations come from non-paid sources.

The uncomfortable truth:

1. You can have perfect account selection, brilliant personalisation, and flawless alignment.
2. None of it may matter if AI doesn't mention you.

Next step:

Run the test. If you're not showing up, that's your answer.

We're helping ABM clients audit their AI visibility - combining earned media strategy with technical optimisation.
