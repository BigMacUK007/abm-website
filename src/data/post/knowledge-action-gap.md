Your marketing team has read dozens of ABM articles.

Watched the webinars. Downloaded the guides.

Yet your pipeline looks remarkably similar to last year's.

Here's why 👇

Teams that UNDERSTAND ABM theory but can't EXECUTE it effectively.

They know they should personalise messaging for different stakeholders.
They recognise the importance of sales-marketing alignment.
They can discuss intent data and buying committees with confidence.

But when pressed to actually:
→ Map a buying committee
→ Build a contact list
→ Craft role-specific messaging
→ Coordinate a multi-channel campaign

They struggle.

Theory hasn't translated to capability.

THE KNOWLEDGE-ACTION GAP

Reading about stakeholder mapping ≠ Actually mapping your target account's buying committee

Self-study provides information.
Workshop training builds CAPABILITY.

Here's what changes with hands-on workshop training:

✅ Practice with YOUR actual accounts (not case studies from 2018)
✅ Expert guidance at critical decision points
✅ Team alignment that actually sticks
✅ Immediate accountability and momentum
✅ Current AI tools and automation (not pre-AI theory)

THE EVIDENCE

Research shows ABM delivers an average 208% increase in revenue when properly implemented.

91% of companies achieve larger deal sizes.
25% see increases exceeding 50%.

But here's the catch: These outcomes require genuine capability - not merely conceptual understanding.

THE REAL COST OF NOT TRAINING

Are your teams:

• Spending 80% of time on research vs. strategic engagement
• Running generic campaigns that waste high-value opportunities
• Missing revenue from winnable accounts
• Under-utilising technology investments
• Falling behind competitors who invested in capability

When viewed through this lens, professional training isn't an expense.

It's one of the highest-ROI investments a B2B organisation can make.

As CIM's ABM Course Director, we deliver both:
→ Public CIM courses (monthly in London)
→ In-house workshops (customised to your accounts, market, and challenges)

If your organisation sells complex solutions to enterprise clients, you cannot afford a marketing team that understands ABM in theory but struggles to execute it in practice.

The question isn't whether ABM training delivers value.

The question is whether your organisation will invest in capability before or after your best target accounts choose competitors who already did.
