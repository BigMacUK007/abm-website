Three things killing ABM programmes

→ Targeting individuals instead of the whole committee
→ Using AI to spam faster, not think smarter
→ Measuring MQLs when buyers have already picked their vendor

What's working instead:

The best teams aren't chasing leads anymore. They're tracking how fast insights move between stakeholders. Finance finds your ROI calculator because IT already vetted your security docs. Procurement gets interested because operations quoted your case study in a Slack thread.
That's not personalisation. That's orchestration.

73% of B2B teams are now using Connected TV because traditional channels are getting ignored. Makes sense—you can't block an ad on your telly whilst ignoring the 30 irrelevant emails in your inbox.

The uncomfortable truth:

Your content isn't built for buying groups. Your ads retarget individuals. Your funnel celebrates single MQLs whilst 19 other people in the account are researching your competitors.

Fix that, and suddenly your conversion rates make sense again.
What's your biggest challenge with buying committees right now?
