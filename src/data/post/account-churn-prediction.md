Did you know: 68% of B2B marketers can't tell if their biggest account is about to churn. Can you?

In today's B2B landscape, losing a key account can be devastating. Yet, many sales and marketing directors are flying blind when it comes to predicting client behaviour.

The root of this problem?

Data silos and misaligned strategies between sales and marketing teams. Your sales team has valuable account insights, but are they reaching your marketers? Your marketing team tracks engagement metrics, but is that information guiding sales conversations?

This disconnect leads to missed opportunities and, worse, surprised exits from accounts you thought were stable.

But what if you could:

📊 Accurately predict account health
🚨 Identify early warning signs of churn
🎯 Trigger timely, personalised interventions
🤝 Align your entire team around key account strategies

This isn't a pipe dream. It can be the reality for B2B organisations leveraging Account-Based Marketing (ABM) strategies.

However, implementing ABM isn't just about adopting new tools. It requires a shift in mindset, processes, and skills across your entire revenue team.

It’s about being ready to transform your approach to key accounts. ABM training equips your team with the strategies and skills to predict, prevent, and proactively engage your most valuable clients.

Let's stop surprises and start driving predictable growth. In the CIM ABM
one-day training workshop we review playbooks for retention and cross-selling.
