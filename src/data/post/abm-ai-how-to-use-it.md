ABM+AI - How to use it

We see successful ABMers leveraging a LinkedIn + AI + Automation framework to boost Account-Based Marketing results:

- Use AI to develop a well-defined Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and Personas, with personal interviews

- Build your business case: establish your competitive positioning, use GAP analysis, profile training needs

- Apply Sales Navigator's search filters to identify prospects matching your ICP and monitor key organisational changes

- Develop personalised content from AI research that addresses specific pain points of target accounts

- Generate customer-hook collateral to add value to the client engagement

- Integrate your CRM system to create consistent prospect contact and follow-up across platforms

- Complement digital outreach with strategic in-person events like
workshops and roundtables

- Combine personalised content and events in your ABM playbook to build influence in your target sectors
