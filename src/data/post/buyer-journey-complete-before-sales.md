"80% of the Buyer's Journey is complete before sales engagement."

But is it true? And what does it mean for your sales and marketing strategy?

Recent studies show:

• Buyer behaviour varies widely across industries - at least some part of the Buyer’s journey is completed before engaging with you or a competitor
• B2B buyers read 3-5 pieces of content for every 1 vendor-produced piece
• Decision-makers use up to 10 channels during their buying process

What does this mean for your Account-Based Marketing (ABM)?

🌐 Be present on every channel your prospects frequent. They are active on multiple platforms.

🎯 Focus on quality over timing. Add value in every interaction.

🔄 Understand that buying isn't a straight line. Map out all the ways you can influence decisions.

What's working now:

🍞 Content Trail Strategy: Create valuable insights across multiple channels: trade media, exhibitions, LinkedIn, webinars etc.

🔍 Decision Point Targeting: Identify and address key contacts and moments in the buyer's journey.

🎯 Account-Specific Triggers: Respond to unique events for each target account: personnel changes, new launches etc.

The goal? Build thought leadership early and often to leverage influence.

Try these:

1. Engage early with valuable, no-strings-attached insights: be an expert on the prospect's problem
2. Create 'prospect magnet' content with a clear call-to-action: research what delivers real value
3. Design an ABM playbook with steps and stages to take the buyer through their journey

Success comes from understanding and aligning your whole team around your target accounts' needs.
