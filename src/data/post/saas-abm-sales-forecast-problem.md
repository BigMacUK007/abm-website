"We have 50 opportunities in pipeline."
Translation: We'll close 10-15 of them.

Because that's what a 20-30% win rate means.

Every SaaS sales leader lives with this brutal arithmetic. You know roughly 70-80% of your pipeline will evaporate.

The question is: which 70%?

After reviewing the latest SaaS sales data and working with enterprise software companies, I've noticed something:

The deals you lose aren't usually about product.
They're about incomplete buying committee engagement.

Your champion loves you. But:

- The CFO never saw the business case
- Procurement flagged compliance concerns
- The CISO questioned your security posture
- Operations worried about implementation complexity

Meanwhile, you were selling to 2 people in a 6-8 person committee.

The SaaS market is growing explosively (£1.3 trillion by 2030). Deals are getting larger. But cycles are stretching to 84 days for mid-market and 6-9 months for enterprise.

The companies with predictable pipelines aren't hoping their champion can sell internally. They're systematically engaging every stakeholder with role-specific value propositions.

CFO gets ROI modelling. Procurement gets security documentation. CISO gets architecture reviews. End-users get demos. All coordinated, all tracked, all personalised.

This used to require an army of SDRs and weeks of research per account.
Now it requires AI-assisted ABM and 3 days.

We teach this methodology and run these programmes for enterprise SaaS companies. The transformation in pipeline predictability is marked.

Question for SaaS sales leaders: What would it be worth to you to move your win rate from 21% to 30%? That's 43% more revenue from the same pipeline.
