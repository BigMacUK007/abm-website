Is your B2B marketing missing its most valuable targets?

I recently spoke with a marketing director who invested six months building a lead generation program. The results? Plenty of leads, but sales complained they were pursuing the wrong companies with the wrong messaging.

The impact was painful: lengthening sales cycles, growing tension between teams, and competitors winning deals they should have secured.

This disconnect happens when marketing casts too wide a net instead of focusing on highest-value accounts with personalised approaches.

When done properly, Account Based Marketing transforms this dynamic. Organisations implementing ABM see their efforts generate an average 208% revenue increase.

What separates successful ABM implementations from failures?

- Strategic account selection rather than casting wide nets
- Sales and marketing alignment around defined account goals
- Insight-driven personalisation at each buyer journey stage
- Clear metrics that connect marketing activities to revenue

Above all, a well-designed ABM playbook of progressive multi-channel, engagement, based on thorough research.

So that everyone in your team knows exactly how you will find, nurture, convert and retain high-value accounts. With the training to understand and confidently execute their role in the process.

For those interested in mastering these approaches, I'm facilitating a CIM-accredited ABM workshop on 12 March. We'll work through practical frameworks you can implement immediately within your organisation.

As ITSMA research confirms, 87% of marketers measuring ROI report that ABM outperforms all other marketing investments. Perhaps it's time to explore whether it could do the same for you?
