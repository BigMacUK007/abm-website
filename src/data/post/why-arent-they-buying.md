"We Have a Great Product. Why Aren't They Buying?"

Here’s what we’ve learned from 300+ enterprise ABM trainings and implementations:

1. Map your actual buyer journey - Not your idealised sales process. Document exactly how problems arise in your target accounts, including the 6-10 stakeholders involved (most invisible to your sales team).

2. Create a shared target account list - Schedule a 3-hour workshop where sales and marketing collaborate on account selection using clear ICP criteria. Sort accounts into two to three tiers for appropriate resource allocation.

3. Develop buyer-centric messaging - Focus on the specific problems your prospects are trying to solve (not your product features). Create content for each stage of their journey.

4. Establish your cross-functional playbook - Define specific multi-touch “plays” for each buying stage, with clear roles for marketing, sales, and subject matter experts.

5. Create keystones in the playbook – To engage directly with prospects, such as through an insight workshop, or a reception with a keynote speaker.

6.      Start small, measure rigorously - Begin with a pilot of 3-5 accounts. Track engagement scores, pipeline progression, and velocity compared to your traditional approach.

The most effective ABM programmes don’t start with expensive tech platforms—they start with sales and marketing alignment around how your buyers actually make decisions.
