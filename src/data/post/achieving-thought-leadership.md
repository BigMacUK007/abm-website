Achieving Thought Leadership

The 95-5 Rule is REAL

Only 5% of your prospects are actively buying right now. The other 95%?

They're watching, learning, and forming opinions about who they'll buy from when they're ready.

This is why ABM isn't just about targeting—it's about nurturing the 95% with strategic, account-specific thought leadership.

The Content Reality Check:
• 52% of decision-makers spend 1+ hours weekly consuming thought leadership
• But 55% will abandon your content within 60 seconds if it doesn't resonate • Only 15% rate the thought leadership they read as "very good"

Translation: There's massive appetite for quality content, but most of what's out there is missing the mark.

The ABM Opportunity:

• 75% research new solutions after reading compelling thought leadership
• 90% become more receptive to sales outreach from companies producing quality content
• 70% question their current suppliers based on what they read

This is ABM gold.

When you create personalised, research-backed content for your target accounts, you're not just marketing—you're positioning yourself as the strategic partner they'll choose when they're ready to buy.

My takeaway? Stop creating generic content and start crafting account-specific insights that speak directly to your key prospects' challenges. The 95% who aren't buying today will remember who provided real value when decision time comes.

What's your experience with thought leadership in your ABM programmes?
