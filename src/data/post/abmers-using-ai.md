ABMers are using AI. But most teams don't have a clear plan. Here's what ABM leaders need to know:

The Numbers:
- 100% of ABM teams now use AI tools
- 60% of marketers spend 4-10 hours per week on AI tasks
- Only 36% have a formal AI plan for their ABM work

Four Ways AI Drives Better ABM Results:

1. Better Targeting - AI helps find the right customers faster. Companies see 5x more qualified leads when they focus on accounts ready to buy.
2. Clear Results - AI tracking connects ABM work to actual sales. Teams can now prove ROI and spend money smarter.
3. Personal Websites - AI creates custom web experiences for each account.
This gets 45% more demo requests from visitors.
4. Fast Content - AI makes personalised content at scale. This cuts campaign launch time by 60% while keeping content relevant.

The Problem: Most teams use AI tools randomly. They don't have a clear strategy. Companies with proper AI plans beat those without plans every time.

What This Means: The advantage window is closing fast. Teams that build smart AI strategies will win in 2025. Those that just use random AI tools will fall behind.

64% of companies still have no formal AI roadmap. Don't be one of them.
