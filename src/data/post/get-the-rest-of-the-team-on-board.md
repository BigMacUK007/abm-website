"Brilliant training. We're ready to implement. One question: how do we get the rest of the team on board?"

This is the moment companies realise certification isn't the finish line. It's the starting block.

You've got two people who understand ABM methodology. You've got twelve people who need to execute it. And those twelve have questions about your accounts, your process, your tech stack.

The public course gave you the frameworks. Now you need to contextualise them and develop the playbooks.

This is exactly why companies follow public training with an in-house workshop later.

Your newly certified champions co-facilitate. We work on your actual accounts. Sales and marketing align on the same approach. Everyone leaves with campaigns ready to launch, not theory to interpret.

Public course builds expertise. In-house workshop scales it across your team.
It's not one or the other. It's the natural progression.
