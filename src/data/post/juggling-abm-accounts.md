Ever wondered if you’re juggling too many ABM accounts? 

Or perhaps not enough? You're not alone.

Despite budget squeezes, companies are doubling down on  Account Based Marketing (ABM) - to align sales and marketing teams on high-value accounts. But here's the key question:

Are you allocating your ABM resources optimally to maximise ROI?

Let's break down the typical coverage ratios, from research by Inflexion Group:

Tier 1. Strategic ABM: 1-3 accounts
Also: Strategic ABM Lite: 5 accounts
Tier 2. Cluster ABM: 10 accounts*
Tier 3. Programmatic ABM: 500 accounts

But before you rush to realign your strategy, remember:

Your ideal ratio depends on your unique business needs, revenue goals, and the team’s ABM capability. This should be set out in your ABM GTM plan.

Here's how to optimise your ABM strategy:

1. Audit your current account distribution against revenue contribution
2. Analyse your deal sizes and sales cycles for each ABM type
3. Assess your available resources and budget allocation
4. Align your ABM types with high-value account tiers
5. Adjust gradually, measuring impact on pipeline and closed deals
6. Ensure your team is aligned with an agreed understanding of ABM

*Interestingly, Cluster ABM has gained significant traction, with most ABM-ers preferring it. This approach might offer a balance between personalisation and scale.

What's your take? Are these ratios in line with your revenue-driving strategies?

Above all, the success of ABM depends on your sales and marketing teams' alignment and understanding of their role in account selection, playbook design for each tier, and campaign execution. It doesn't happen naturally, it takes training.
