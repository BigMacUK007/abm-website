Is your approach on time?

Did you know that by the time a B2B prospect reaches out to your sales team, they're already, on average, 57% through their buying journey? It's also reported that only some 5% of prospects are actively in-market looking for solutions like yours at any one time.

Interestingly, 80% of buyers continue engaging with content for information gathering and knowledge building, even when not actively purchasing

So how should we respond and adapt to this? Here's what leading ABM practitioners are doing:

- Meet your target accounts in their research phase with invaluable data addressing their pain-points, interests and goals. Whether your key decision-makers are on LinkedIn, industry forums, or searching Google, your messaging should find them with laser-focused relevance.

- Smart ABM teams are winning by creating strategic content libraries tailored to specific account personas. Instead of generic resources, they're developing targeted insights that speak directly to their priority accounts' unique challenges.

- The clincher? According to Gartner, 74% of enterprise buyers choose vendors they trust to solve their specific problems. This means your ABM content strategy must demonstrate deep understanding of each target account's unique situation - beyond just product features.

Pro tip: While others wait for inbound leads, successful ABM practitioners are already nurturing relationships with key accounts through personalised, insight-rich content mapped to each stage of their buying journey.

What's your experience with the silent phase? How are you adapting your strategy to reach buyers earlier in their journey? Do you want some practical guidance?
