The Future of B2B Marketing: ABM+AI. Why Strategy Must Lead, Not Follow

Account-Based Marketing is at a crossroads.

The promise was always clear: target high-value accounts, align teams, personalise engagement, drive revenue. But execution? That's where most organisations stumble.

Here's what's changing:

- ABM isn't a tactic anymore—it's the strategy The distinction between "account-based marketing" and "marketing" is disappearing. In complex B2B sales, everything should be account-focused.

- The MQL trap is real Chasing lead volume creates activity, not outcomes. The future belongs to those measuring buying group engagement, pipeline influence and actual revenue impact.

- AI is a multiplier, not a solution Yes, AI makes personalisation scalable. But automation without strategy just creates faster noise. We're seeing 20-30 irrelevant AI-generated emails daily - proof that technology without customer understanding fails.

- Strategy first, always think of accounts like an investment portfolio. Your enterprise accounts are blue-chip stocks requiring premium attention. Your growth accounts need targeted but scalable approaches. Different investments, different returns.

The bottom line: Marketing leaders must speak the language of revenue, not lead counts. Own account plans alongside sales. Build strategies grounded in business fundamentals before selecting technology.

The tools exist. The question is: do you have the strategy to use them properly?
