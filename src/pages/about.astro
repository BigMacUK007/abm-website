          <strong>ABM is fundamentally changing.</strong> The manual research, generic messaging, and complex planning that defined traditional ABM no longer work at the speed and scale modern B2B requires.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <strong>AI isn't replacing ABM—it's unlocking its full potential.</strong> By automating the time-consuming research and execution tasks, AI allows teams to focus on strategic thinking, relationship building, and delivering genuine value to target accounts.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <strong>But technology alone isn't the answer.</strong> Successful ABM Prospector requires the right combination of methodology, tools, training, and strategic alignment. That's why we offer a complete ecosystem—from done-for-you services to team training to strategic planning support.
