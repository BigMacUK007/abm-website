- **Upscaled resolution**: Higher quality for modern displays
- **Optimized quality**: 90% quality setting balances size and visual fidelity
- **Local hosting**: Faster load times vs. external URLs

## Next Steps

The images are now live on the website. The dev server should show them at:
- Homepage: http://localhost:4321/
- About page: http://localhost:4321/about

All images are production-ready and optimized for web use.
